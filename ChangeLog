	* concurrent-EvoStar-2019.Rnw: Revises final version without experiments in the hanged computer. Autothreading was tested for the WEA paper, and individual-based concurrency with a heavier function was also tested. It wasn't worth the while, since apparently at least a couple of seconds of operation are needed for communication to be worth the while. Less than that makes communication too heavy.

	* utils/chart.R: Two more experiments, or sets of experiments, should be proposed:
	1. Try with a generation gap of 16, to see if we achieve a slight improvement in the number of evaluations per second.
	2. Repeat all three experiments with other population sizes to account for lack of initial diversity.
